### 📂 3. Folder Structure Overview

```
project-root/
├── todo-frontend/     # Vue.js front-end
├── todo-backend/      # Express + MongoDB backend

### ⚙️ 4. Backend Setup

#### Step 1: Navigate to backend folder
```bash
cd todo-backend
```

#### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 3: Create `.env` file

In `todo-backend/`, create a `.env` file with your MongoDB URI:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

> If using MongoDB Atlas, the connection string looks like:
> `mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/todoapp?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

#### Step 4: Start the backend
```bash
node index.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000
✅ MongoDB connected
```
